### Our Goals

We are a group of people who have passion in the open source code community. Our goal for this service is to provide the greatest possible convenience to developers so that they don&rsquo;t have to set up a personal web server just to showcase their projects because we know the open source code is mostly built with a lack of financial support and is intended not to get any benefit financially. We want to keep it like that, so you can focus only on the development process.
