  <p>With screenshot service, we can capture any web-page just by its URL and then turn it into a PNG or JPG image. We don&rsquo;t have to open the web browser, turn on browser extension and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>. It&rsquo;s okay if we want to do it just once, but what if we need to capture 50 of web pages? It means we need to do it again and again whenever we want to capture screenshots of the web-page.</p>
  <p>Instead of doing that manually, we can get any web-page screenshot simply by pasting a web-page URL to the text field above.</p>
